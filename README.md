# OCR Pro Root

## Description

OCR Pro is a software designed to scan PDF documents and convert them into text (TXT) files. This is particularly useful in situations where documents are poorly scanned, damaged, or exhibit other complexities that make traditional OCR (Optical Character Recognition) solutions, such as those integrated into Word, unable to recognize the text accurately.

## Features

- **PDF Document Scanning**: OCR Pro can process PDF files, even if they are poorly scanned or damaged.
- **Text Conversion**: The software converts scanned documents into editable text files.
- **Robust Solution**: Designed to handle cases where traditional OCR solutions fail.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
